# üöÄ Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to your React project, created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This boilerplate sets up a modern web development environment with zero configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, see the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready for deployment!\
For more information, check the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is a one-way operation!**

If you want to customize the build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.

**Warning:** Once you `eject`, you cannot go back! This command gives you full control over the build configuration, but you're on your own.
